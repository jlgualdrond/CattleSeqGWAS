# CattleSeqGWAS
This project conducts a sequence-based GWAS in Belgian Blue cattle by combining HD genotypes with WGS from 230 bulls to impute sequence-level variants in ~15K animals. The imputed data were analyzed across 11 traits, and significant markers defined QTL regions and credible sets, enabling the detection of candidate genes for growth and body size.
